* Get the code running in intellij
.* Get the normal demo working with a mocked out queue
.* Go through the code making a list of things that you need to change and do them.
.* Create a readme for this project
. , How to build it
.  . java command?
. , How to set it up
.  . Config files (active mq endpoints)
. , How to run it
.  . How do you run the tests
.  . How to start up the server


* Get it to work with activemq
.. Setup active mq on your own machine
.. Should be able to parse active mq messages
* Flow calculation
.. Node should become red when the flow along a particular node exceeds some threshold
* Adding unit tests
.. Add unit tests for the back end
.. Concentrate on the flow 
* Writing regression tests to demonstrate that the UI reflects the status of the order pipeline
.. Selenium for performing these tests
. , Setup a sample selenium test
* Load testing the application
.. Generate a bunch of orders on activemq
.. Need some way of determining when the visualization has updated some of its component
. , Read the javascript as red or not?
* Some way of deploing it
.. Simple javascript app.
* Organize meeting with ali to start forwarding events from event hub.

* Packaging it into a WAR to deploy on a tomcat server

* Refactoring the code to minimize code changes introduced by adding new events/nodes/edges.
.. Get the front end to add new nodes

* Done:
.. Getting code working with intellij
. , Try debugging the current issues:
.  . Added project sdk -  1.8
.  . Cannot find symbol java for the import?
.   , Cannot import java.lang
.    . Cannot find java stuff in a new class as well.
.    . Check the settings - What is the classpath when compiling
.    . Check on stack overflow
.    . Try and reproduce the error locally
.   , 
.  . Cannot find the dependencies
.   , jgrapht-ext - deletedg
.   , socketio
. , Recreate the project
