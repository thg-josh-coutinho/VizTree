* So the things that need to be done are as follows:
.. Get flow graph to compile
. , 
.. Implement the handler for edge updated events
. , Create the class for grouping edge updated fields
. , Implement the functionality to update the listeners in the graph class
.. Handle edge weight updated events by sending, (source, target, new edge weight)
. , Add socket io to the app
.  . In one of the listeners add the transition functionality to the corresponding edge.
.. Initialize the graph and route its events to the stream used for updates
.. Implement a buffering agency on the server side that buffers graph event updates and sends them to the visualizer every 'x' milliseconds.
.. Setup activemq
.. Create your own activemqs that send events to you
