* Need to add data-sources to the activemq
* Correct the edges to display the flow through the system
* Should flag as red only when the flow is below a threshold
* Add active mq to the mix

* Fade out background nodes when considering one subgraph

* Need to have all of them with the same original opacity
* Need to add a proper graph
* Need a way to configure arbitrary graphs
* Need to generalize input sources
* Why does it not go back to blue when the thickness shrinks to less than 10
* Why does it get highlighted to red even though the thickness is not above the default thickness
